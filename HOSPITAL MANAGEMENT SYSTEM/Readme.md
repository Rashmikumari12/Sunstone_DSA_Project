# 3. Hospital Management System

# Description:
Build a hospital management system that manages patient records, doctor appointments, and medical inventories efficiently.

# Features:
* Data Structures: Use trees to store and manage patient records for efficient search and retrieval.
* Scheduling Algorithms: Implement scheduling algorithms to manage doctor appointments and allocate time slots efficiently.
* Inventory Management: Use hash tables to manage medical inventory, track stock levels, and generate alerts for low stock.
* Search and Sort: Implement efficient search and sorting algorithms to quickly find patient records and inventory items.
* Security: Ensure data security and privacy through encryption and access control mechanisms.

# 1. Data Structures: Managing Patient Records with Trees
Using trees (e.g., binary search trees, AVL trees, or Red-Black trees) allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of patient records.
# Implementation Steps:
•	Define Patient Class: This will store patient details (name, ID, age, medical history, etc.).
•	Create Tree Structure: Use a binary search tree to store patients. Each node will contain a Patient object.
•	Operations: Implement methods for inserting a new patient, searching for a patient by ID, and deleting a patient.

# 2. Scheduling Algorithms: Managing Doctor Appointments
Efficient scheduling algorithms can help allocate time slots for doctor appointments.
Implementation Steps:
•	Define Appointment Class: Store details about appointments (patient ID, doctor ID, time slot, etc.).
•	Schedule Management: Use a priority queue or a heap to manage appointments based on time.

# 3. Inventory Management: Using Hash Tables
Hash tables provide efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations for managing medical inventory.
Implementation Steps:
•	Define InventoryItem Class: Store details about inventory items (name, quantity, threshold for alerts, etc.).
•	Hash Table: Use Python’s dictionary to manage inventory.

# 4. Search and Sort
   Algorithms: Binary Search, Quick Sort, Merge Sort
• Search Patient Records: Quickly find records using binary search on tree-based structures.
• Sort Inventory Items: Organize items using efficient sorting algorithms for quick retrieval.
# 5. Security
  Mechanisms: Encryption, Access Control
• Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data like patient records and inventory details.
• Access Control: Restrict access based on user roles (e.g., admin, doctor, nurse).
• Audit Logs: Maintain logs of data access and modifications for monitoring and compliance.
