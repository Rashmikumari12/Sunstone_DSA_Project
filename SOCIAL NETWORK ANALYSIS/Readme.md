# Social Network Analysis

# Description:
Develop a social network analysis tool that can analyse the relationships and interactions within a network of users. The tool should be able to identify key users, detect communities, and visualize the network structure.

# Features:
●	Graph Representation: Implement the social network using adjacency lists or adjacency matrices.
●	Centrality Measures: Calculate and display centrality measures such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality.
●	Visualization: Use a graph visualization library to display the network, highlighting key users and communities.

Creating a Social Network Analysis (SNA) tool involves several steps. Below is a detailed outline to help you develop this tool, including code snippets for key features and libraries that can be used.
# Step 1: Graph Representation
You can represent the social network using adjacency lists or adjacency matrices. For this task, I'll use NetworkX, a powerful library for the creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks.
# Step 2: Centrality Measures
Calculate various centrality measures to identify key users in the network
# Step 3: Community Detection
Identify communities within the network using community detection algorithms. The Girvan-Newman algorithm is one approach, but for simplicity, we'll use the Louvain method provided by the community library.
# Step 4: Visualization
Visualize the network using a graph visualization library like Matplotlib with NetworkX.

# Additional Considerations
•	User Interface: To make the tool more user-friendly, consider building a web or desktop application using frameworks like Flask (for web) or Tkinter (for desktop).
•	Scalability: For larger networks, ensure your tool is optimized for performance. Consider using graph databases like Neo4j for efficient querying and analysis of large-scale networks.
